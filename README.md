# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from ride-sharing app PyBer. Once the data was cleaned, we used the data to gain insight
on use of the app by city type.

## Results

After interpreting the data, we can see that Urban cities use the app more frequently than Suburban and Rural cities.

As we can see in these two graphs, Urban cities had a higher total number of rides. Rural cities tend to have higher fares, but fewer drivers and rides. 
Suburban cities have a moderate number of rides, and fares tend to be higher in Suburban cities than in Urban cities.

As displayed in the graph above, Urban cities have more drivers than Suburban and Rural cities as well.

While Rural cities tend to have higher fares, Urban cities account for the majority of fares.

From the monthly analysis, we can see that Urban fare prices fluctuate the most, with the lowest fare price of 60 in January and peaking at over 100 near the end of February.
All city types peaked at the end of February.
