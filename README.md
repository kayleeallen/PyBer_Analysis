# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from ride-sharing app PyBer. Once the data was cleaned, we used the data to gain insight
on use of the app by city type.

## Results

After interpreting the data, we can see that people from urban cities use the app more frequently than suburban and rural cities.

As we can see in these few graphs, urban cities had a higher total number of rides. Rural cities tend to have higher fares, but fewer drivers and rides. 
Suburban cities have a moderate number of rides, and fares tend to be higher in Suburban cities than in Urban cities.

As displayed in the graph above, Urban cities have more drivers than Suburban and Rural cities as well.

While Rural cities tend to have higher fares, Urban cities account for the majority of fares.

The monthly analysis further supports the observation that Urban cities consistently generates more business than rural or suburban cities. 
All the city types experienced a peak near the end of February, though rural cities had their highest peak at the beginning of April.
The total fares from urban cities fluctuated the most, with a range from approximately $1,750 in January to a peak of almost $2,500 at the end of February and again peaking at about the same amount early in March. 

## Insights and Recommendations

Overall, there is a significant difference between the use of PyBer in urban, suburban, and rural cities. 
This makes a lot of sense considering people in urban cities are a lot less likely to own cars than people who live in suburban or rural cities.
Urban cities are also more densely populated, so there is a larger population of potential customers.
The high fare costs for those in rural cities could deter customers in rural cities from using the app. 
There are some limitations, however. While we know average fare cost from the data, we don't know what the average trip length is. The higher fares
for rural cities could be the result of longer trips. 

One recommendation I would make is to provide incentives for those in rural cities to become drivers.
If there are more drivers in rural cities, that could potentially decrease fare price and encourage more people to use the service.
Also, people who live in rural cities tend to know their neighbors better than those in suburban and urban cities. If a person knows a family or friend who is a driver for PyBer, they may be more inclined to use the service in order to support the driver.

Another recommendation I would make is to concentrate marketing on urban cities.
While urban cities already have the most users, there is also a larger potential customer base. I would concentrate marketing on urban cities to set PyBer apart from competitors in order to retain existing customers and also gain new ones.

A third recommendation I would make is to run promotions around holidays in suburban cities. While most people in suburban cities own cars, a large reason for using ride sharing services is for when people go out drinking and are unsafe to drive. People tend to go out drinking more around holidays. I would run promotions around the holidays in suburban cities in order to encourage people to use PyBer for their night out rather than a competitor.
