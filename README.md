# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data from ride-sharing app PyBer. Once the data was cleaned, we used the data to gain insight
on use of the app by city type.

## Results

After interpreting the data, we can see that Urban cities use the app more frequently than Suburban and Rural cities.

As we can see in these two graphs, Urban cities had a higher total number of rides. Rural cities tend to have higher fares, but fewer drivers and rides. 
Suburban cities have a moderate number of rides, and fares tend to be higher in Suburban cities than in Urban cities.

As displayed in the graph above, Urban cities have more drivers than Suburban and Rural cities as well.

While Rural cities tend to have higher fares, Urban cities account for the majority of fares.

The monthly analysis further supports the observation that Urban cities consistently generates more business than rural or suburban cities. 
All the city types experienced a peak near the end of February, though rural cities had their highest peak at the beginning of April.
The total fares from urban cities fluctuated the most, with a range from approximately $1,750 in January to a peak of almost $2,500 at the end of February and again peaking at about the same amount early in March.
